# Beyond the Genome Workshop

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/chandlersutherland/beyond_the_genome/blob/master/Beyond_the_Genome.ipynb)

This colab notebook and the associated data have been given as a workshop on genome sequencing and long read data. The notebook is accessible to non-coders and introductory biologists. They can also work as a self-guided tutorial on using nanopore sequencing data for plant biology/pathology research. This repository includes step by step base calling of *Arabidopsis* NLR `.fast5` files and alignment to the gene of interest. To get started, open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab and click along! :sparkles: 

The background slides used in this workshop provide an overview of the history of sequencing and nanopore basecalling and are included as `.pdf` and `.pptx` files.
