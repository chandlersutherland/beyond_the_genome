# Beyond the Genome Workshop

This colab notebook and the associated data act as a workshop and tutorial on using nanopore sequencing data for plant biology/pathology research. This repository includes step by step base calling of Arabidopsis NLR `.fast5` files and alignment to the gene of interest. To get started, open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab and click along! :sparkles: 

The background slides used in this workshop provide an overview of the history of sequencing and nanopore basecalling and are included as `.pdf` and `.pptx` files.
