# Beyond the Genome Workshop

This colab notebook and the associated data act as a workshop and tutorial on using nanopore sequencing data for plant biology/pathology research. This repository includes step by step base calling of Arabidopsis NLR .fast5 files and alignment to the gene of interest. 

The slides used in this workshop are included as `.pdf` and `.pptx` files.
